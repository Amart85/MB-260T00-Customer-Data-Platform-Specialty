# Lab 1.1: Verify environment
# Module 1: Get started with the Customer Data Platform

## Approximate Time to Complete - 30 mins 

 

This appendix contains step-by-step instructions to provision and configure a Customer Insights environment, including prerequisites. 

## Step 1: Power Apps License 

1. Now that you have a working Office 365 tenant, we will add a Power Platform trial license to the tenant. Open a new tab and navigate to [https://powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/)[.](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) On this page you will see a **Try free button** on the top right. Click that button and enter the email for the admin account you were provided. 

2. Click **Sign in** and enter your password provided. If prompted, enter a phone number.

3. Click **Get started**. You will be taken to the Power Apps homepage. Press **Skip** if prompted with a tutorial.

## Step 2: Power BI Trial  

1. You will also need a Power BI Trial to create a nice dashboard showing the information from Customer Insights. To get started navigate to [https://aka.ms/trybi](https://aka.ms/trybi)[](https://aka.ms/trybi) in a new tab.

 2. You will be prompted to use your M365 admin credential. Click **Continue** to confirm and follow the same steps in the task above to add the Power BI trial.

3. Click **Get started**. It may take a minute or two for Power BI to get set up.

## Step 3: Dynamics 365 Marketing Trial 

Now that we have users with licenses in our Office 365 tenant, we can create our demo Dynamics environments. 

1. Navigate to [https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/marketing](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/marketing)[](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/marketing). 

2. Select the **Marketing** box and click **Try for free.** Enter your M365 admin email. You will then be prompted to enter your country and phone number.

3. After clicking **Continue,** it may take a moment for the trial to build. When the **Launch trial** button appears, click to enter the Dynamics 365 Marketing application.


## Step 5: Customer Insights Trial 

Now that we have setup our Admin user, Power Apps license and Dynamics 365 Marketing trial, we are ready to request our trial of Customer Insights. 

1. Open a new tab and navigate to [https://aka.ms/tryci](https://aka.ms/tryci)[.](https://aka.ms/tryci).

2. Click **Continue** to stay signed in using your M365 admin account. Fill out the necessary information and click **Continue.**

3. Click **Get started.**

4. If prompted to enter your country again, select the appropriate country and continue.

5. Select **Audience insights** on the **Choose your focus** page.

6. Select **Individual consumers (B-to-C)** on the **Choose your business** page.

7. Your trial will launch and you'll arrive on the Audience insights homepage. Click on the **Start trial** button in the header.

8. Next you will create the environment. We suggest you name it **Your Name** CI ILT Lab. Once you enter the name and select the region you can click **Review and finish** and then **Create.**

10. Once it completes you will be at the landing retail demo page for Customer Insights. Switch to your environment by clicking on top right at **Environment** and you are good to start on the labs.
