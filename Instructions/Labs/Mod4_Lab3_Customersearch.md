## Exercise 2 - Customer Search

In Lab 4A we completed the **Map -> Match -> Merge** process to result in a unified customer profile. 

 

In this lab we will setup Search and Filter criteria to enable Customer Insights users to search for unified customer profiles so that you can quickly pull information on a specific customer or group of customers. 

 

### Task 1 - Configure the Search Columns and Filter Index 


1. Click Customers in the left menu bar 

 
2. Click Search & Filter Index 

 

3. Few customer search specific fields are already added by default and you can add more by clicking Add on the right-hand side 

 

	Make sure CustomerId, FirstName, 
LastName, FullName, DateOfBirth, Email, PostCode, Headshot, ContactId, LoyaltyId, are selected. 

 

4. These selected attributes will be indexed and used when searching for a Customer profile. 


	You can also apply string filters like sort attributes from A-Z or Z-A or highest to lowest frequency. To do that, click Add filter across the selected search attributes. 

 

5. Once after you review, click Save and Run

### Task 2 - Search for a Customer Record 

 

1. Click Customers in the left menu bar. You should now be presented with a set of customer cards, representing the Unified Profiles. You can expand cards to see more about the customer or sort the cards with various fields by clicking on Expand cards and Sort options on the top.

2. You can use the search bar to search for Text attributes relating to unified customer profiles. E.g. Searching '24502' will search against all text attributes and return matches and partial matches. 


	Use the search bar to answer the following questions. 


	- What is Brian Gobble's Date of Birth? 

	(Search with value 'Brian Gobble') 


	- Which customer has Loyalty Card ID LOYID_5707? 

	(Search with value 'LOYID_5707') 

	

	Which customer has a postcode of 24502? 

	(Search '24502')
