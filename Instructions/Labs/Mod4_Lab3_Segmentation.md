# Lab 4.3: Create segments
# Module 4: Work with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

You will create marketing segments to promote Contoso Coffee's new Cold Brew Coffee offering as well as to identify customers with a higher-than-average online spend whom Contoso wish to target with their new subscription and connected coffee machine services. 

These segments will allow Contoso Coffee Marketing to deliver personalised, targeted marketing journeys for upcoming product launch. 
  
## Exercise 1 - Create segments

Segments enable you to group your customers into cohorts based on demographic, transactional, or behavioural customer attributes. Using segmentation, you can achieve more targeted actions such as promotional campaigns, sales activities, or customer support actions to achieve desired business goals. You can define complex filters around the Customer Profile entity and its graph of related entities. Each segment, after processing, outputs a set of customer entity records that you can export and take actions upon. 

Segments can be static (defined at the point you activate them) or Dynamic. If you create a Dynamic segment, customers will drop in and out of the segment as they meet or no longer meet the criteria you define. 

Using Customer Insights, Segments can be exported to Dynamics 365 Marketing or several other business applications and used to execute a targeted Customer Journey. Segments can also be exported to .csv or accessed via API. 

Customer Insights also provides insights over the created segments. Using Segment insights, you can find what differentiates two segments or what they have in common. Segment overlap shows which customers are common among the segments. Segment differentiators helps you find what differentiates a segment from the rest of your customers or the other segments. With both of these insights you can compare the segments against attributes and measures. 

In this lab you will segment your unified customer profiles, to uncover cohorts of customers with similar attributes. There are two ways to create segments. First you can create them manually using the New > Blank Segment button on the top left of the screen after clicking on Segments in the left-hand menu. However, there is a new way using one of the Create from options on that page. We will do it all the ways. At the end, we will review each segment and apply insights over them to discover additional information. 


### Task 1 - Segment using Profiles: Customers from California 

Let's create a segment called Customers from California quickly using the profiles. 

1. If you haven't already, sign into Customer Insights at https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/. 

3. Click on **Segments** in the left menu. 

3. Click the **+ New** dropdown and select **Create from Profiles**. 

4. Select the **Field > State** and **Value > California**. 

5. Click **Review**. 

6. Name your segment "Customers from California" and verify the output entity name has been automatically populated with **CustomersFromCalifornia**. 

7. Click **Save**. 

### Task 2 - Segment using Measures: High Value Online Customers 

Contoso Coffee Marketing wants to run a new promotion to convert customers to subscription model. Marketing have identified that they wish to target brew-at-home customers with a higher than average online purchase value to do so. We will create this segment using the Quick Create. 

1. Click on **Segments** in the left menu. 

2. Click the **+ New** dropdown and select **Create from Measures**. 

3. Select the **Average Web Purchase ($)** attribute. 

4. Set the operator to **greater than**. 

6. Set the value to **138**. The graph should populate with Average Web Purchase ($) by percentile. 

6. Click **Review**. 

7. Name your segment "High Value Online Customers" and verify the output entity name has been automatically populated with **HighValueOnlineCustomers**.

8. Click **Save**. 


### Task 3 - Segment from scratch: Summer Promo 

Contoso Coffee Marketing want to run a new Summer Promotion targeting millennials with a higher than average in-store purchase with their newly launched Cold Brew Coffee. We will create this segment manually. 

1. Click on **Segments** in the left menu. Click on **+ New** and select **Build your own.**

2. Next to "Untitled segment," select **Edit details** and change the name to "Summer Promotion" and verify the output entity name has been automatically populated with "SummerPromotion" and click **Done**. 

3. Under **Rule 1**, in the text box that reads "Enter an attribute name...", start typing "Average Store Purchase." Select **Average Store Purchase ($)** from the dropdown. 

4. Set the condition to **is greater than or equal to 113.** (Note: 113 is the average in-store purchase we calculated earlier.) 

5. Click **+ Add condition**. An **and** condition will be added. 

6. In the "Attribute name" box, start typing "dateOfBirth" and select **dateOfBirth** from the dropdown menu. 

7. Fill out the rest of the condition as **is on or after 1/1/1981**. 

7. Add another condition with an **and** qualifier. 

8. Set this condition as **DateOfBirth is on or before 12/31/1996**. 

7. Click **Run**.

### Task 4 - Review Segments 

1. Wait for all your segments to successfully run, then navigate to the Customer Insights Home Page. You should see your segments displayed. 

2. Click on one of your segments. You should be presented with a preview of the customers included within your segment, as well a timeline highlighting the segment size. This display increases and decreases in the number of segment members as data changes over time and the segment is re-run. 

3. Now that you have created your segments, you are ready to start acting upon your data. You can select the segment and click Download on the Command Bar for use in 3rd party software, or you can setup an Export Destination. Segments created within Customer Insights can be made available to other parts of the Power Platform, Dynamics 365 Marketing or external applications. 

### Task 5 - Apply Segment Insights 

Let's try to find out common customers that belong to both Customers from California and High Value Online Customers segments and also what differentiates both of these segments in terms of Reward points and LifetimeSpend. 

1. Click on **Segments** in the left menu, then click on **Insights (preview)** tab and click on **+ New** on the command bar. 

2. You will now see two options. Let's create using **Differentiators** first to see what distinguishes both of these segments. Click on **Differentiators**. 

4. Choose **High Value Online Customers** as primary segment. Hit **Next**, choose **Customers from California** as another segment, and then hit **Next**. 

5. Now choose **Reward points** under Customer fields and **LifetimeSpend** under Measure fields to see how the above segments differ from each other with respect to Reward points and LifetimeSpend. Deselect all other customer fields and measure fields. 

6. Click **Next** and name your insight "High Value Online vs Customers from California" with an Output entity name of HighValueOnlinevsCustomersfromCalifornia. Click **Save**. 

7. After the run is successful, you can click on the created insight. Click on the Attributes or Measures tabs to see how the segments differ from each other with respect to the fields you selected. Observe the **Difference score**, which signifies the degree of difference. The higher the score the more different they are. You may need to refresh the browser window to see the results. 

8. Click on each measure and attribute to see deeper insights. 

9. We have successfully created segment insights using **Differentiators**. Now letâ€™s create an insight using **Overlap**. 

10. Make sure you are still in the **Insights (preview)** tab and click on **+ New** in the top left corner. Choose **Overlap**. 

11. Select both **High Value Online Customers** and **Customers from California** segments to find out their shared customers. 

12. Click **Next**. 

13. Here, as an optional step, you can also choose attributes to compare the segments just as we did with the Differentiators. You can simply hit Next without choosing anything. 

14. Name your insight "High Value Online Overlapped with California Customers" and set the Output entity name as "HighValueOnlineOverlappedwithCaliforniaCustomers." Then click **Save**. 

15. After the run is successful, you can click on the created insight to see the screen detailing the total and percentage of shared customers between the two segments. 


### Task 6 - Segment Expansion 
Segment Expansion can be used to find similar customers to your segment customer base using Artificial Intelligence. 

Earlier we created a segment called **Summer Promotion**, which contains millennial customers with higher than average in-store purchase. Now, let us expand that segment and find customers that are similar to them for us to market our newly launched Cold Brew Coffee. 

1. Click on **Segments** in the left menu and choose the **Summer Promotion** segment. This will become our source segment. 

2. Click on the three vertical dots and choose **Find similar customers.**

3. Name your segment "SummerPromoExpansion." 

4. Click on **Add fields** in the next step to select attributes and measures that are used to find similar customers. We'll target customers with similar average in-store purchase and location, so choose **PostCode** and **AverageStorePurchase**. Then click **Apply.**  

5. Next you must choose who to consider: either all customers except from source segment, or customers from a different segment. If different segment is selected, then we must choose which segment it is. For now, select All customers except source segment. 

6. Now the maximum number of customers to include must be selected. By default, 20% of the customers is selected which can be altered. Let's stick with 20%. 

7. If you like to include members from source segment as well then check the note at the bottom. Otherwise, leave it unchecked. For our purposes, we can leave it unchecked.

8. Hit **Run.** 

9. After the run, you can see a new segment being created. Click on the segment to find the similarity scores, which range from 0.55 to 1(0.85-1 -> Very similar, 0.7-0.85 -> Similar, 0.55-0.7 -> Somewhat similar). You can also explore the similar customer records.

## Exercise 2 - Get suggested Segments 
Use Suggested Segments to discover interesting segments based on a customer attribute or measure of interest.

### Task 1 - Discover segments based on a numeric customer attribute or measure of interest  

1. Under the Segments section, click on the **Suggestions (preview)** tab. 

2. Click on **Get Suggestions** to begin the configuration experience. 

3. We will choose **Improve a measure/metric** and click **Start.**

4. Next, you need to select the target attribute (i.e., a customer attribute or measure of interest), for which you want to discover segment suggestions. We will select the previously created measure **LifetimeSpend** as the target attribute. Click **Next.**

5. Next, you will select the attributes that might influence the target attribute (LifetimeSpend) so that the AI model can find interesting patterns between the influencing attributes and the target attribute and suggest segments based on those patterns. We will select **Email Subscriber, Income, Loyalty Tier, Occupation and State** as the influencing attributes. 
  **Note:** In case you do not know which attributes to select, it is advised to select many attributes so that the model can analyze, and surface segment suggestions based on the underlying patterns it uncovers. However, if you want to see how certain attributes influence "LifetimeSpend", you can choose only those as well.

6. Click on **Run.** The AI model will start finding patterns between the selected influencing attributes and the target attribute to surface segment suggestions. Please wait for a few minutes for the model to finish its analysis. 

7. Once the model has finished running and if it is able to uncover patterns between the influencing attributes and the target attribute, segment suggestions will be displayed under the **Suggestions (preview)** tab. 

    Since we've chosen a numeric attribute as the target attribute, segment suggestions include those where the average value of the chosen target attribute (LifetimeSpend) is significantly higher or lower that the average LifetimeSpend value across all customers. We will also explore a scenario where a categorical attribute (Eg - Customer Satisfaction: low/medium/high) is chosen as the target attribute in the next task. 

   Each segment suggestion card denotes how the average LifetimeSpend in that segment compares to the overall average. The number of customers in the suggestion as well as the rules learned (i.e. common traits of customers in the segment) are also highlighted. 
   
   E.g. - in the above suggestion, LifetimeSpend is 20% above average i.e. the customers in this segment have historically spent much more as compared to others. There are 585 members in this segment and they have Income > 97k and a high Loyalty Tier. 

8. You can click on any suggestion to see more details in the side panel. We will click on the See suggestion link for the suggestion that says LifetimeSpend is 15% below average. In the side panel, you will see the following: 

- Comparison of average LifetimeSpend of customers in this segment compared to all the customers 

- Number of customers in the segment and its proportion as compared to the entire customer base 

- The attribute values i.e., the rules that the model learned based on the selected influencing attributes. 

In this case, customers in this segment have an average LifetimeSpend of 741.89 as compared to average LifetimeSpend of 869.74 across all customers. There are 599 members in this segment which is 12% of the entire customer base. These customers are not Email Subscribers, have an income less than 44k, do not belong to the high loyalty tier and are teachers. This information can then be used to target customers in this segment with personalized messaging to drive more revenue and corresponding business goals. 

 In a similar fashion, you can see details of other segment suggestions that you are interested in. 

9. You can then save the segment by clicking on **Save as segment** in the side panel. Name the segment and Output entity name as follows and click on **Save.**
  
10. The saved segment can then be viewed under the All segments tab and it can be used for downstream processes like any other dynamic segment. If you wish to look at the rules that the model learned after saving a segment, you can do so by clicking on Edit in the All segments tab. 

11. We have successfully found segment suggestions based on a measure of interest (LifetimeSpend). We also saved a segment which can then be utilized for downstream processes like any other dynamic segment. 

### Task 2 - Discover segments based on a categorical customer attribute or measure of interest 

1. Under the Suggestions tab, click **+ Find new suggestions** on the top command bar to explore segment suggestions based on a different customer attribute or measure. Note that, this will replace the existing set of suggestions. 

2. We again will choose **Improve a measure/metric**.

3. Select **CustomerSatisfaction** as the target attribute of interest. Customer Satisfaction is a categorical attribute with 3 categories (low/medium/high) and weâ€™d like to find segment suggestions based on this attribute. Then click **Next**. 

4. Next, select **Email Subscriber**, **Income**, **Loyalty Tier**, **Occupation**, **RewardsPoints** and **State** as the influencing attributes. 

5. Click **Run**. The AI model will start finding patterns between the selected influencing attributes and the target attribute to surface segment suggestions. Please wait for a few minutes for the model to finish its analysis. 

6. Once the model has finished running, segment suggestions will be displayed under the Suggestions (preview) tab. Since the target attribute is categorical, the AI model tries to find patterns/common traits of customers belonging to a particular category of the target attribute and surfaces segment suggestions. Since Customer Satisfaction has 3 different categories - low, medium and high - the AI model will try to find segments of customers that possess the same traits and a significant portion of them belong to a particular category (i.e. either low, medium or high). 

    **Note:** While only a few tiles are shown initially, you can click the **See more ->** link to see more suggestions that were found. 

7. You can click on any suggestion to see segment details in the side panel. We will click on the suggestion that says 83% of customers in this suggestion have CustomerSatisfaction = low. In the side panel, you will see the following: 

- Comparison of percentage of customers in this segment that have CustomerSatisfaction = Low as compared to percentage of all customers that have CustomerSatisfaction = Low 

- Number of customers in the segment and its proportion as compared to the entire customer base 

- The attribute values i.e. the rules that the model learned based on the selected influencing attributes. 

In this case, 83% of customers in this segment have CustomerSatisfaction = low as compared to 26% among all customers. There are 488 members in this segment which is 10% of the entire customer base. These customers are live in California, do not belong to the high loyalty tier, are not Teachers and do not live in Florida. This helps provide insight that 94% of customers having the above-mentioned traits have a low customer satisfaction. This information can then be used to target customers in this segment with personalized messaging and/or customer service to help improve their customer satisfaction and in turn address corresponding business goals. 

In a similar fashion, you can see details of other segment suggestions that you are interested in. 

8. You can then save the segment by clicking on Save as segment in the side panel. The segment can then be viewed under the All segments tab and it can be used for downstream processes like any other dynamic segment. If you wish to look at the rules that the model learned after saving a segment, you can do so by clicking on Edit in the All segments tab. 

9. We have successfully found segment suggestions based on a categorical attribute of interest (CustomerSatisfaction). We also saved a segment which can then be utilized for downstream processes like any other dynamic segment.
