# Lab 4.3: Search for customers
# Module 4: Work with Dynamics 365 Audience insights

In this lab we will setup Search and Filter criteria to enable Customer Insights users to search for unified customer profiles so that you can quickly pull information on a specific customer or group of customers. 

### Task 1 - Configure the Search Columns and Filter Index 


1. Click **Customers** in the left menu bar.

2. Click **Search & filter index.** 

3. Some customer search specific fields are already added by default and you can add more by clicking **Add** on the right-hand side. Click **Add** now.
 
5. Make sure **CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, FullName, DateOfBirth, Email, PostCode, Headshot, ContactId,** and **LoyaltyId** are selected. Click **Add.**

5. Click **Save** and then click **Run.**

### Task 2 - Search for a Customer Record 

1. Click **Customers** in the left menu bar. You should be presented with a set of customer cards, representing the Unified Profiles. You can expand cards to see more about the customer or sort the cards with various fields by clicking on **Expand cards** and **Sort options** on the top. 

2. You can use the search bar to search for text attributes relating to unified customer profiles. (E.g. Searching '24502' will search against all text attributes and return matches and partial matches.)

Use the search bar to answer the following questions. 

- What is Brian Gobble's Date of Birth? (Search with value 'Brian Gobble') 

- Which customer has Loyalty Card ID LOYID_5707? (Search with value 'LOYID_5707') 

- Which customer has a postcode of 24502? (Search '24502')
